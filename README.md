# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
[My Work Day Scheduler Website!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-05-work-day-scheduler/)  
For this week's homework, I created a simple calendar application using Moment.js and jQuery.  
The purpose of building this project was to allow users to save events for each hour of the day so that they can keep track of their schedules.  

The timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether the time has passed, is present, or in the future.

## Installation
The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:
  1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
  2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
  3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
  4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website. 

## Usage
To use my website, click into a timeblock to enter an event.  
Then, click on the save icon to the right so that the saved event persists even when the page is refreshed.
